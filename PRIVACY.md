# Privacy Policy

AccessiAI does **not** collect, store, or share any personal data from users.

All processing happens locally in the user's browser whenever possible.  
If a secure proxy (Cloudflare Worker) is used to access Gemini APIs, only the **text explicitly selected by the user** is sent for processing.  
This text is processed in real-time and immediately discarded — it is **never logged, stored, or used for tracking**.

AccessiAI fully complies with Chrome Web Store policies and respects user privacy.  
If you have any questions, you can contact the developer through the GitHub repository.
